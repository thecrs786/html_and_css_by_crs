<!--
================ HOVER TRANSITION RULES =================

1. Transition in NORMAL state only:
   - Animates whenever the element's properties change to or from this state.
   - Hover-in: smooth
   - Hover-out: smooth
   - Result: TWO-WAY animation by default.

2. Transition in HOVER state only:
   - Animates only while :hover is active.
   - Hover-in: smooth
   - Hover-out: instant (no animation)
   - Result: ONE-WAY animation (hover-in only).

3. Transition in BOTH NORMAL and HOVER states:
   - Animates in both directions.
   - Hover-in: smooth
   - Hover-out: smooth
   - Result: same as normal-only, redundant.

4. Only HOVER-OUT animation:
   - Trick: put transition in normal state and disable it in hover using `transition: none;`
   - Hover-in: instant
   - Hover-out: smooth
   - Result: ONE-WAY animation (hover-out only).

========================================================
Remember: 'transition' applies only when the selector containing it is active.
Normal state transition = applies when returning or any change toward normal.
Hover state transition = applies when entering hover state.
