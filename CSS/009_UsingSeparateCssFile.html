<!-- We use a separate css file to make the html file less confusing and heavy.
    we create a .css file and  Then we use the link element to access it.
    It makes the file smaller and more focused-->

<!-- The Link element is a void element i.e it doesn't need a closing tag-->

<!-- NOTE: Always place <link rel="stylesheet"> in the <head> section.
That’s the correct, professional, and standard way — both for browser efficiency and clean HTML structure.-->
